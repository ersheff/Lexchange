# Laptop Ensemble Exchange

The **Laptop Ensemble Exchange** is a community-supported resource where laptop ensemble members, directors, and composers can share and discover repertoire and knowledge. This project grew out of challenges that I have faced as a laptop ensemble director, particularly in finding pieces to rehearse and perform, as well as navigating general technical and pedagogical hurdles with the group. It is currently being tested by a small group of users with similar needs before wider release.

Anyone can browse the collection, but an account is required to submit new content.

The site uses [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io) for database and user management, with a custom front end built using [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev) and [Water.css](https://watercss.kognise.dev). [EasyMDE](https://github.com/Ionaru/easy-markdown-editor) and [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) provide Markdown editing and viewing for user-submitted content.

Hosted on [Fly.io](https://fly.io).
